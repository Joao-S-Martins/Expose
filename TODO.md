# TODOs
[ ] Parallax images. Treat background as real image and top image like overlayed text.
[ ] Fixed scroll images.
[ ] Figure out mini gallerys (4x4 or 6x4 clickable photo grid).
[ ] Glideshow: Scroll text over fixed/zooming background. Bonus: include additional images in the text space.
[ ] Fix splash image height.
[ ] 50/50 split image/text layout. Reversible for text/image.
[ ] Text overlay on images or maybe following images.
[ ] Cool scrolling transitions, like the FAASL site.
