# TODOs
[ ] Parallax images. Treat background as real image and top image like overlayed text.
[x] Fixed scroll images.
[ ] Figure out mini gallerys (4x4 or 6x4 clickable photo grid).
[ ] Glideshow: Scroll text over fixed/zooming background. Bonus: include additional images in the text space.
[x] Fix splash image height.
[ ] 50/50 split image/text layout. Reversible for text/image.
[ ] Text overlay on images or maybe following images.
[ ] Cool scrolling transitions, like the FAASL site, using Motion UI.
[ ] Upgrade to Foundation.
[x] Fix issue where portraits record height as max-width.
[ ] Off-canvas about & nav.
[ ] Image replace using Interchange.
[ ] Magellan for smooth navigation & progress bar.
[ ] Hover thumbnails for progress bar.
[ ] Vertical progress bar on left or horizontal progress bar on bottom?
[x] Sticky menu button to off-canvas nav.
[x] `full-width` image class to fit to width and scroll for image. Default behavior.
[x] `fit-screen` image class to fit photo to screen without clipping.
[x] `fill-screen` image class to fill screen height and width, clipping necessary.
[x] `portrait` image class to fill screen height and clip width if necessary.
[x] `landscape` image class to fill screen width and clip height if necessary.
[x] `focus-*` image class to shift clipping. `*` can be `left` or `right` and `top` or `bottom`. Vertical directions work with `portrait`. Horizontal directions work with `landscape`. All directions work with `fill-screen`.
[x] `fixed-window` image class to fix any image to the background. Works with all other image classes.
[ ] Define text display classes for splitting and overlaying.
